The simplicity arises from the fact that it is a basic key-value store and not a full-fledged database system that provides querying and schema constraints. It offers flexibility by being schema-less and by providing convenient mechanisms to include and discard features. BerkeleyDB provides complete ACID compliance through its five subsystems, namely, caching, datastore, locking, logging and recovery. All these five subsystems are implemented using concepts like two-phase locking, undo/redo write-ahead logging, etc. This enables it to offer high performance for a variety of workloads and handle very large-sized key-vale stores (order of Terabytes). Due to these properties, many applications like filesystems, LDAP servers and database systems (like MySQL) use BerkeleyDB for their backend storage requirements.","Key/Value,Document / XML","Custom API,SQL,PL/SQL",Embedded,http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/overview/index.html,https://github.com/berkeleydb/libdb,,Sleepycat Software,US,1994,,"Commercial,Open Source",,"C++,Clojure,D,Delphi,Eiffel,Erlang,Go,Haskell,Java,JavaScript,Lisp,Lua,Matlab,Ocaml,Perl,PHP,PL/SQL,Prolog,Python,R,Rebol,Ruby,Scala,Smalltalk,Tcl,Visual Basic",,"AGPL v3,Apache v2","AIX,Android,BSD,DOS,HP-UX,iOS,Linux,OS X,Solaris,VxWorks,Windows,z/OS","Key-value,Document",Y,berkeleydb/libdb,berkeleydb,libdb,Y

It supports most of the SQL-92 features. Each party interacting with CovenantSQL is either a client, a block producer, or a miner: When a client sends a connection request, the request is directed to one node among a group of block producers. The block producers maintain a public blockchain (main chain). When a block producer receives a request, it allocates a number of miners. The miners self-organize and produce a separate block chain, called a shard chain. Each miner is an independent database engine running SQLite. CovenantSQL uses Go's driver for SQLite to interact with individual miners. The main chain implements Delegated Proof-of-Stake, which provides eventual consistency among block producers. The block producers pack all SQL queries from clients along with the shard chain's signature into the main block chain. The shard chains themselves consist of database contents and query results. The miners pertaining a shard chain use Byzantine Fault-Toleranted Raft, which provides strong consistency among miners that serve the same client.

Internally, Druid uses Zookeeper for cluster node coordination, a relational database like MySQL or Postgres to keep track of metadata, and a deep storage system such as HDFS for storing data. Druid also has low latency between the event creation and when it can be queried, which makes Druid desirable for real-time analytics. Druid stores incoming data in a unique format called a segment to allow fast aggregations for arbitrary dimensionalities of data.

This design choice optimizes DuckDB for analytical queries, and in embedded scenarios, it enables high-speed data transfer to and from the database. To ensure transactional guarantees (ACID properties), DuckDB employs its custom bulk-optimized Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) and enables data to be stored in persistent, single-file databases.

As opposed to streaming systems like Spark Streaming which require using Java/Scala for development, KSQL provides a completely interactive, SQL only interface improving the ease of access.

It's also possible for Pinot to dynamically merge data streams that come from both offline and online. Pinot divides tables into segments, which are immutable sets of tuples. Tuples inside each segment are organized in columnar manner. Segments are basic units in Pinot. In server nodes, data from Kafka and Hadoop / HDFS are processed and cached as segments. They store metadata, indexes, and necessary zone maps for their tuples. Storage optimizations are applied inside each segment; Indexes are built for each segment. Query plans and optimizations are also generated and performed on a per-segment basis. An internal building block of Pinot is Apache Helix.

As the cost of storage dropping, a more effective way of managing data is to enforcing immutability of key's value. And writing to the database is close to functional, such that writing side doesn't have to wait for shared resources, the read side will figure out the correct result. In order to have control over querying costs, it provides an embedded executable imperative language, PumpkinScript, which is a low-level untyped language inspired by,MUMPS,.

Pluggable: Leveraging the micro kernel and 3 layers pluggable mode, features and database ecosystem can be embedded flexibily.

ZODB aims to provide a transparent way for Python programmers to make their data persistent. It is completely written by Python, and only provides Python API. It does not support other programming languages. ZODB stores data as objects, and the relationship between objects are automatically maintained by Python object references. As a result, ZODB allows programmers to manage data structures with complicate relationships. The storage layer of ZODB is pluggable, and there are three main implementations: ZEO, NEO, and RelStorage. ZEO is a single-server client-server framework using FileStorage as the backend; NEO extends ZEO to distributed-server client-server storage; RelStorage stores objects in a relational database backend, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. ZODB uses aggressive caching. As a result, it is not suitable for tasks with heavy writes. Also, ZODB is mainly designed for mapping access through keys and attributes of objects, which means that it does not support queries containing joins and advanced search.",Object-Oriented,Custom API,Shared-Everything,http://www.zodb.org/,https://github.com/zopefoundation/ZODB,http://www.zodb.org/en/latest/reference/index.html,Zope Foundation,US,2002,,Open Source,Python,Python,,Zope Public License,,Object oriented,Y,zopefoundation/ZODB,zopefoundation,ZODB,Y
